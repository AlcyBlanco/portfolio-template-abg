#P01 - Portfolio Project


**Reponsive Framework:** Foundation

**CSS Preprocessor:** SASS with Compass

Listed below are the resources that referenced while completing this project.

I started the project using Boostrap which matched the provided mockup, but decided that I wanted to do something a little more challenging with Foundation. All changes and the switch to foundation are detailed in the commit history. 

I would ideally like to have separate pages for each featured project as opposed to providing further information on each project in a modal, but I wasn't 100% sure if it was a requirement to include modals in the project or not. For brevity I have included them in the meantime
